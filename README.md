The paper presents a nonlinear Helmholtz (NLH) equation with high frequencies and corner singularities, and develops a linear finite element method (FEM) to discretize it.2. The authors derive wave-number-explicit stability estimates and singularity decomposition for the NLH problem, and establish a priori stability and error estimates for the FEM on shape-regular meshes, including locally refined meshes.3. A new residual-type error estimator is derived, which is equivalent to the standard one, but with a significant result: it seriously underestimates the error of the FE solution in the preasymptotic regime.4. Based on the new error estimator, the authors prove the convergence and quasi-optimality of the resulting adaptive finite element algorithm (AFEM) for the NLH problem, when the initial mesh size lies in the preasymptotic regime.5. Numerical examples validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency of the AFEM in simulating nonlinear optical phenomena, such as optical bistability with Gaussian incident waves.|[2405.15344v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15344v1)|null|
