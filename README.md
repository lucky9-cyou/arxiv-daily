|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|The paper's abstract and introduction discuss the limitations of traditional continuous Gaussian models in modeling and forecasting discrete-time series processes. The authors propose the Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR) model, which can provide coherent forecasts for discrete-time series with overdispersion. They compare the PLINAR model with traditional Gaussian AR(1) models and two modified versions of the Gaussian AR(1) model using Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kolmogorov metric. The authors also apply the models to a real-world data set and find that the PLINAR model outperforms its Gaussian counterparts.In summary, the key contributions of the paper are:1. The introduction of the Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR) model for modeling and forecasting discrete-time series with overdispersion.2. A comparison of the PLINAR model with traditional Gaussian AR(1) models and two modified versions of the Gaussian AR(1) model using Kullback-Leibler divergence and Kolmogorov metric.3. An application of the models to a real-world data set, which shows that the PLINAR model outperforms its Gaussian counterparts.The paper's main focus is on the development and comparison of the PLINAR model with traditional Gaussian AR(1) models, with the goal of providing a more accurate and coherent forecasting method for discrete-time series with overdispersion.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions**|Ofir Gorodetsky et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. The authors prove a central limit theorem for sums of random multiplicative functions, which is a class of functions that includes the z-th divisor function and the indicator function of squarefree integers.2. The limiting distribution is a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with the function.3. The authors show that the random measure is singular continuous and its support is related to the fractal properties of the function.4. They also prove that the limiting distribution is stable, meaning that it remains the same under certain types of transformations.5. The authors provide several examples of functions to which their result applies, including the z-th divisor function, the indicator function of squarefree integers, and the indicator function of integers with k prime factors.These contributions provide new insights into the behavior of sums of random multiplicative functions and have implications for number theory and probability theory.|[2405.20311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311v1)|null|
