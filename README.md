Gidaro et.al.|The key contributions of the paper can be summarized as:1. The authors compared the performance of the Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR(1)) model with a traditional Gaussian AR(1) model and two modified versions of the traditional Gaussian AR(1) model in forecasting discrete time series.2. The authors showed that the PLINAR(1) model is more suitable for modeling and forecasting discrete time series with overdispersion, which is a common phenomenon in real-world data.3. The authors introduced two methods for equating the moments of the PLINAR(1) model to the Gaussian AR(1) model, and compared the performance of the two methods using Kullback-Liebler divergence and Kolmogorov metric.4. The authors applied the PLINAR(1) model to a discrete time series data set with overdispersion and compared its performance with the Gaussian AR(1) model and its modified versions.

|**2024-05-30**|**Semantic Landmark Detection & Classification Using Neural Networks For 3D In-Air Sonar**|Wouter Jansen et.al.|The paper's abstract and introduction summarize the contributions as:1. Developing a convolutional neural network (CNN) that detects and classifies 10 different landmark reflectors with varying radii using in-air 3D sonar.2. The CNN uses a bio-inspired representation of the reflected echoes, modeled after the inner ear of a biological species such as an echolocating bat, in the form of a cochleogram.3. The network achieves a 97.3% classification accuracy on the test dataset and predicts landmark orientation angles with an RMSE lower than 10 degrees.4. This advance improves the robustness and accuracy of autonomous systems in challenging environments, such as indoor settings with optical interference or dust, where traditional sensing modalities struggle.The introduction highlights the challenges of developing autonomous systems in harsh environments, where traditional sensing modalities like lidar and cameras are affected by optical interference or other environmental factors. It also introduces the concept of in-air sonar, which can provide resilience to these challenges and offers a novel approach for detecting and classifying reflector landmarks.|[2405.19869v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19869v1)|null|
