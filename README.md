|**2024-05-24**|**Sparse Expansion and Neuronal Disentanglement**|Shashata Sawmya et.al.|The main contributions of this paper are:1. **Sparse Expansion**: A one-shot pruning technique that expands a language model into a mixture of sparse experts, each of which is a copy of the original weights, pruned for a specific cluster of input values.2. **Disentangling neurons**: The paper shows that the mixture of sparse experts is effective in disentangling the output distributions of individual neurons across clusters of input values, which improves the performance of the model.3. **Wasserstein distance**: The paper uses the Wasserstein distance between a neuron's output distribution and a Gaussian distribution as a metric to quantify the degree of entanglement of a neuron, and shows that highly entangled neurons are more difficult to sparsify.4. **Improved performance**: The paper demonstrates that Sparse Expansion outperforms other one-shot pruning techniques in terms of parameters activated per token, across LLMs from the Llama and Pythia families, with minimal loss in accuracy.5. **Inference speedup**: The paper shows that Sparse Expansion can achieve non-trivial speedups for generative inference, with a variant of the approach providing speedups of 3x and 4.8x for the largest linear layers in Llama 2 7B and 70B, respectively.|[2405.15756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15756v1)|null|

The paper proposes a new local Bayesian optimization algorithm, MinUCB, which replaces the gradient descent step with minimizing the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) in the GIBO algorithm.2. The paper shows that MinUCB can achieve a better local exploitation strategy than direct gradient descent, and maintains a similar convergence rate with GIBO.3. The paper further improves the acquisition function of MinUCB through a look-ahead strategy, leading to a more efficient algorithm called LA-MinUCB.**Introduction:**1. Bayesian optimization is a popular method for solving high-dimensional black-box function optimization problems.2. Local Bayesian optimization methods focus on finding a local optimum instead of the global optimum, which can be more practical for high-dimensional problems.3. The paper introduces the approximated gradient class of methods, including GIBO and MPD, which are based on minimizing the posterior variance of the gradient at a given location.4. The paper motivates the development of a new local Bayesian optimization algorithm by pointing out that GIBO and MPD may not fully utilize the information provided by the Gaussian process surrogate.The key contributions of the paper are the development of the MinUCB algorithm, which is a new local Bayesian optimization algorithm that replaces the gradient descent step with minimizing the UCB, and the improvement of the acquisition function of MinUCB through a look-ahead strategy, leading to the LA-MinUCB algorithm.|[2405.15285v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15285v1)|null|

|**2024-05-23**|**A central limit theorem for coefficients of L-functions in short intervals**|Sun-Kai Leung et.al.|The paper's abstract and introduction provide an overview of the main contributions, which are:1. A central limit theorem for the sum of coefficients of a general L-function in short intervals of appropriate length, assuming the generalized Lindelöf hypothesis (GLH), a weak generalized Ramanujan conjecture, and a Rankin-Selberg type partial sum estimate.2. The result generalizes Hughes-Rudnick's result on lattice point counts in thin annuli to a broader class of L-functions.3. The proof relies on the dual sum, which is the Voronoï summation formula without twists.The main theorem, Theorem 3.1, states that under the assumed conditions, the sum of coefficients of an L-function in short intervals has a Gaussian limiting distribution. The proof involves bounding the variance of the sum using the method of moments and tracking the dependencies on the parameters.The references provided at the end of the paper include various works on number theory, including the Lindelöf hypothesis, the Ramanujan conjecture, and the distribution of prime numbers.|[2405.14834v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14834v1)|null|
