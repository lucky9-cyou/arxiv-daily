The authors propose a general theoretical description of spin self-diffusion under nonlinear gradient fields, extending the effective phase diffusion method for linear gradient fields.2. They show that under nonlinear gradient fields, spin diffusion can exhibit three types of phase evolutions: phase diffusion, float phase evolution, and shift-based phase evolution, which can significantly affect the NMR signal.3. The authors derive general expressions for the phase variance and corresponding NMR signal attenuation under nonlinear gradient fields, including parabolic and cubic fields.4. They demonstrate that the signal attenuation obeys Gaussian attenuation for short times, but changes to Lorentzian or Mittag-Leffler function attenuations when the time increases, which is different from Gaussian attenuation.5. The authors show that for spins starting diffusion far away from the origin, the signal attenuation is Gaussian, but the float phase still has an important effect on the total phase shift of even-order gradient fields, which can be used to measure the diffusion coefficient directly.6. They perform random walk simulations to support the obtained theoretical results and demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method for handling random order nonlinear gradient fields.Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive framework for understanding spin self-diffusion under nonlinear gradient fields and has implications for the development of advanced experimental techniques for NMR and MRI.|[2405.18514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18514v1)|null|

The paper proposes a three-level hierarchy of marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which involves iterative optimisation, gradient estimation, and linear system solving.2. The authors show that the dominant computational cost of the method is the solution of large positive-definite systems of linear equations.3.
