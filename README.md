Introduction of an equivalence relation on the set of lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, where equivalent lattices share identical structures of Gabor frames, up to unitary equivalence.2. The equivalence classes are parameterized by symplectic forms on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ and consist of lattices related by symplectic transformations.3. The number of parameters required to describe the possible structures of Gabor systems over lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ is reduced from $4d^2$ to $2d^2 - d$.4. The symplectic transformations are characterized as the structure-preserving transformations of the time-frequency plane in the context of Gabor analysis.5. The paper also investigates the equivalence classes that have separable lattices as representatives and finds that the parameter space in this case is $d^2$-dimensional.6. The paper provides a higher-dimensional variant of the Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallstén theorem for Gaussian Gabor frames, giving necessary and sufficient conditions for $d$-parameter families of Gaussians to generate Gabor frames.In summary, the paper establishes a connection between symplectic geometry and Gabor analysis, providing a reduction in the number of parameters required to describe the structure of Gabor systems, and characterizing symplectic transformations as structure-preserving transformations.|[2405.18125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18125v1)|null|

The authors propose a three-level hierarchy for marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes.2. They identify that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations.3. They introduce a warm start approach by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, which amortises computations and achieves speed-ups.**Introduction Overview:**The authors provide an introduction to Gaussian processes, noting their popularity in machine learning due to their ability to model complex probabilistic dependencies. However, their scalability is often limited by the need to solve large linear systems, particularly when computing the marginal likelihood. They discuss existing methods for approximate marginal likelihood estimation, which are based on iterative methods and have computational costs proportional to the square of the number of training data points. They argue that existing methods may be slow for large datasets, and therefore propose a novel approach based on iterative marginal likelihood optimisation using linear system solvers.**Main Results:**1. A three-level hierarchy for marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which uses iterative methods and linear system solvers.2. A warm start approach to amortise computations by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step.3. Experiments showing that the proposed approach achieves speed-ups up to 16x on regression tasks while maintaining equivalent performance.**Main Methods:**1. Gaussian processes (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) for modelling complex probabilistic dependencies.2.

|**2024-05-12**|**Hologram: Realtime Holographic Overlays via LiDAR Augmented Reconstruction**|Ekansh Agrawal et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:The paper proposes an application that creates real-time holographic overlays using LiDAR augmented 3D reconstruction, capable of running on a portable device like an iPhone 14 Pro. The paper presents three high-fidelity reconstruction tools that can achieve metric accurate facial reconstructions.The paper highlights the limitations of existing methods, such as SLAM and NeRFs, which require highly calibrated scenes, incur steep computation costs, or fail to render dynamic scenes. The proposed approach aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging the complementary strengths of geometric and photometric information from LiDAR and computer vision techniques.The paper presents three attempts to achieve real-time 3D facial reconstructions: monocular depth estimation, LiDAR + TrueDepth, and template modeling. The first attempt uses Intel MiDaS as the core backbone of the depth estimation pipeline, while the second attempt uses the iPhone 14 Pro's LiDAR and TrueDepth sensors and a custom-trained SRCNN model to upscale the LiDAR depth frame. The third attempt uses a deep-learning approach to render a facial reconstruction and apply texture + mesh transformations directly through an end-to-end approach.|[2405.07178v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07178v1)|null|
