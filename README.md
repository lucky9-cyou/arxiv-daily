Gidaro et.al.|The key contributions from the paper are:1. The Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR) process is introduced as a model for discrete-valued time series with overdispersion.2. The k-step-ahead conditional PMF for the PLINAR process is derived and compared with the marginal method and innovation method for approximating the Poisson-Lindley PMF.3. The forecasting performance of the PLINAR model is evaluated using the conditional mean and variance, and compared with the traditional Gaussian AR(1) model and two modified versions of the Gaussian AR(1) model.4. The innovation method is shown to be preferred when values of ฮฑ and ฮธ are close to zero or one, while the marginal method is preferred when values of ฮฑ and ฮธ are moderate to large.5. The PLINAR model outperforms its Gaussian counterparts in forecasting a discrete-valued time series with overdispersion.The paper also provides a thorough investigation of the PLINAR process, including its definition, conditional PMF, and forecasting performance.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|
