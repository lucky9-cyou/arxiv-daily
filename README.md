|**2024-05-30**|**Characterization of probability distributions on some locally compact Abelian groups containing an element of order 2**|Gennadiy Feldman et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:The paper generalizes the Heyde theorem, which characterizes Gaussian distributions on the real line by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another, to groups of the form R × F, where F is a finite Abelian group with a 2-component isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 2. The coefficients of the linear forms are arbitrary topological automorphisms of the group. This generalization is done using a new method that simultaneously considers both the characteristic functions and the distributions themselves.The paper's main theorem states that if the conditional distribution of the linear form L2 = ξ1 + αξ2 given L1 = ξ1 + ξ2 is symmetric, then the distributions µj are either Gaussian distributions on the subgroup R or degenerate distributions. The theorem is proved by reducing the problem to solving a functional equation for characteristic functions on the character group of the original group.The paper also provides several lemmas and propositions that are used in the proof of the main theorem. These results include a characterization of the Gaussian distributions on the group R × F, a description of the distributions that are characterized by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another, and a necessary and sufficient condition for a distribution to be a Gaussian distribution on the subgroup R.|[2405.20087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20087v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Characterization of probability distributions on some locally compact Abelian groups containing an element of order 2**|Gennadiy Feldman et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction can be summarized as:* The authors generalize the Heyde theorem, which characterizes the Gaussian distributions on the real line by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another, to groups of the form ℝ × F, where F is a finite Abelian group with a 2-component isomorphic to the additive group of the integers modulo 2. The coefficients of the linear forms are arbitrary topological automorphisms of the group.* The authors derive a new class of probability distributions characterized by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another on these groups.* The proof is purely analytical and relies on methods of abstract harmonic analysis and complex analysis.In particular, the authors provide a characterization theorem for the Gaussian distributions on the group ℝ × F, which generalizes the Heyde theorem to a more general setting.|[2405.20087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20087v1)|null|

The authors use the Gaussian representation of determinants to estimate the free energy and entropy of the principal minors within the Bethe approximation. They focus on the Laplacian matrix of random regular graphs of degree K=2, 3, 4 and show that these matrices are asymptotically exact in interacting systems with locally tree-like structures. The authors also study the zeros of the partition function in the limit of large powers and demonstrate the absence of a finite-temperature phase transition in this class of matrices.|[2405.19904v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19904v1)|null|
