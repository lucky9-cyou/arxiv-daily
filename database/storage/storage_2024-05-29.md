The paper focuses on the case where the inputs are natural image statistics and the target distribution is a spherical Gaussian. The introduction also discusses the relationship between the physiological and anatomical properties of local interneurons and the coordinated response properties of populations of primary neurons, which remains unclear.In summary, the key contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:* A normative computational model that establishes a relationship between the properties of interneurons and the coordinated, nonlinear transformations of sensory circuits.* A model that optimizes an optimal transport objective to transform the inputs to achieve a target response distribution.* A demonstration of the model's ability to learn a nonlinear transformation that significantly reduces statistical dependencies in neural responses.|[2405.17745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17745v1)|null|
