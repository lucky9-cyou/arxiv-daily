Gidaro et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:**Key Contributions:**1. The paper investigates the use of a Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR(1)) model for forecasting discrete time series.2. The authors compare the PLINAR(1) model with traditional Gaussian autoregressive (AR) models and two modified versions of the Gaussian AR model.3. The authors evaluate the performance of the PLINAR(1) model using two methods: the marginal method and the innovation method.4. The paper applies the PLINAR(1) model to a real-world data set on sex offenses in New Jersey.5. The authors discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the PLINAR(1) model, including its ability to handle overdispersion and its potential applications in other fields.**Introduction Summary:**The paper introduces the PLINAR(1) model as a new approach for forecasting discrete time series. The authors note that traditional Gaussian AR models are often used for modeling and forecasting discrete data, but these models may not be suitable for data with overdispersion. The PLINAR(1) model is a more flexible alternative that can handle overdispersion and other features of discrete time series data. The paper reviews previous work on discrete time series models and highlights the importance of using more flexible models for forecasting discrete data.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

Gidaro et.al.|The paper's abstract and introduction highlight the importance of discrete time series modeling, particularly when dealing with overdispersed data. The authors propose the Poisson-Lindley Integer-Valued Autoregressive (PLINAR) process as a more suitable model compared to traditional Gaussian autoregressive models. The PLINAR process is shown to provide coherent forecasts, which is crucial when dealing with discrete data.The key contributions of the paper can be summarized as:* Introducing the PLINAR(1) process as a new model for discrete time series analysis* Showcasing the improved performance of the PLINAR(1) process compared to Gaussian autoregressive models* Highlighting the importance of coherent forecasting in discrete time series modeling* Providing a comparison of the marginal method and innovation method for approximating the conditional Poisson-Lindley PMFThe paper concludes that the PLINAR(1) model outperforms its Gaussian counterparts, particularly in overdispersed data, and that the model's coherent forecasts make it a suitable choice for discrete time series modeling.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

The authors face the challenge of estimating the parameters of compact binaries that coalesce and produce gravitational waves, which is a multifidelity problem with varying assumptions, levels of fidelity, and computational cost.The paper highlights the difficulties in applying importance sampling to large problems, such as gravitational wave inference, due to the sensitivity of the effective sample size to the chi-squared divergence between the target and biasing probability distributions. To address this issue, the authors propose tempering the biasing distribution, which increases the coverage of the target distribution and improves the overlap in the tails. The optimal temperature is found to be critical for achieving the best efficiency in the method.The authors also discuss the broader applicability of their results, recognizing that the focus on gravitational wave inference has implications for other problems that involve multifidelity models, optimization, uncertainty propagation, data assimilation, control, and sensitivity analysis.In summary, the paper's abstract and introduction describe a new method for accelerating gravitational wave parameter estimation using tempered multifidelity importance sampling, and highlight the potential broader applications of this approach in various fields.|[2405.19407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19407v1)|null|
