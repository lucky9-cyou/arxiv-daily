The protocol is based on the idea of uniformly precessing observables, which have the same dynamics in both classical and quantum theories. The paper shows that the even-parity protocol can detect states that are missed by similar protocols built from Tsirelson's original precession protocol.The main contributions of the paper are:1.

|**2024-05-28**|**On the Structure of Multivariate Gabor Frames and a Higher-Dimensional Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallstén Result**|Michael Gjertsen et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The authors introduce an equivalence relation on the set of lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, which identifies lattices that share identical structures of Gabor frames, up to unitary equivalence.* They show that symplectic transformations are the only linear transformations that preserve the structure of Gabor systems, and characterize them as the structure-preserving transformations of the time-frequency plane.* They parameterize the equivalence classes of lattices in a natural way, and provide a sufficient condition for unitary equivalence that is simple to check.* They use this framework to formulate and prove a higher-dimensional variant of the Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallstén theorem for Gaussian Gabor frames.* They also explore the case of separable lattices and show that non-separable and irrational lattices can behave exactly like separable and rational ones.These contributions provide a new understanding of the structure of Gabor frames and their relationship to symplectic geometry, and have implications for the study of multivariate Gabor systems and their applications.|[2405.18125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18125v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement**|Jinyan Chen et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. The introduction of an even-parity precession protocol, which can detect nonclassicality in quantum systems, including Wigner negativity and entanglement, using only measurements of a uniformly-precessing observable at different times.2. The protocol can be implemented in various physical systems, such as the quantum harmonic oscillator, spin ensembles, and collective degrees of freedom.3. The even-parity protocol is designed to detect states that commute with the parity operator, which were missed by similar protocols built from Tsirelson's original precession protocol.4. The protocol can detect Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of even numbers of qubits using only collective spin measurements, which closes a long-standing gap in the field.The paper's main results can be summarized as follows:1. The quantum harmonic oscillator: The authors show that the even-parity protocol can detect Wigner negativity and entanglement in the quantum harmonic oscillator, and that the maximum score is at least the classical bound.2. Spin ensembles: The authors show that the even-parity protocol can detect GHZ states of even numbers of qubits using only collective spin measurements, and that the maximum score is at least the classical bound.3. The relationship between quantum violation and Wigner negativity: The authors show that the Wigner negativity volume is bounded by the quantum score, and that the lower bound approaches 1/K as σ → 0.The paper's results have implications for the study of nonclassicality and entanglement in quantum systems, and demonstrate the power of the even-parity precession protocol in detecting nonclassicality and entanglement in a wide range of physical systems.|[2405.17966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17966v1)|null|
