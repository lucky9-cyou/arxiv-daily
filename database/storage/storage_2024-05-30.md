|**2024-05-28**|**Covariance Operator Estimation via Adaptive Thresholding**|Omar Al-Ghattas et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. Introducing a covariance operator estimator that adaptively thresholds the sample covariance function using an estimate of the variance components.2. Deriving an operator norm bound on the estimation error in terms of the sparsity level of the covariance and the expected supremum of the normalized process.3. Demonstrating the advantage of adaptive threshold estimators over universal threshold and sample covariance estimators in nonstationary settings.Specifically, the paper studies sparse covariance operator estimation for nonstationary Gaussian processes with sharply varying marginal variance and small correlation lengthscale, focusing on the infinite-dimensional setting. The authors introduce a covariance operator estimator that adaptively thresholds the sample covariance function using an estimate of the variance components and prove a bound on the operator norm error in terms of two dimension-free quantities: the sparsity level and the expected supremum of the normalized field. This shows that adaptive thresholding can lead to an exponential improvement in sample complexity over sample covariance estimators in challenging regimes.|[2405.18562v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18562v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**Effective phase diffusion for spin phase evolution under random nonlinear magnetic field**|Guoxing Lin et.al.|The key contributions of the paper are:1. The authors propose a general theoretical description of spin self-diffusion under nonlinear gradient fields, which extends the effective phase diffusion method for linear gradient fields.2. They reveal that there are three types of phase evolutions: phase diffusion, float phase evolution, and shift based on the starting position.3. The authors show that the phase from float phase evolution is missed or misplaced in traditional methods, which leads to incorrect NMR signal attenuation or phase shift.4. They provide a general expression for the phase variance and corresponding NMR signal attenuation, which demonstrates that signal attenuation obeys Gaussian attenuation for a short time, then changes to Lorentzian or Mittag-Leffler function attenuations when time increases.5. The authors also discuss the limitations of existing theories, such as the need to develop new theoretical treatments for nonlinear gradient fields, and the importance of considering higher-order gradient fields.6. They propose a method for calculating the signal attenuation for spins starting diffusion from a random position, and provide a general expression for the average phase shift in all even-order gradient fields.7. The authors verify their theoretical results using random walk simulations, which support the obtained theoretical expressions.8. They provide a broader view of phase evolution under the influence of a nonlinear gradient field, including various aspects such as phase diffusion coefficient, phase variance, phase distribution, and signal attenuation.|[2405.18514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18514v1)|null|

The paper proposes a three-level hierarchy for marginal likelihood optimisation in iterative Gaussian processes, which can be divided into iterative optimiser, gradient estimator, and linear system solver.2. The authors identify that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations, and propose to amortise computations by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, providing a warm start.3. The warm start approach allows for a trade-off between compute time and accuracy of a solution, and can achieve up to a 16√ó average speed-up among datasets while providing the same results as the conventional procedure.In summary, the paper presents a new approach to marginal likelihood optimisation in iterative Gaussian processes, which can significantly reduce computational costs by reusing solutions of linear system solvers.|[2405.18328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18328v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**Warm Start Marginal Likelihood Optimisation for Iterative Gaussian Processes**|Jihao Andreas Lin et.al.|The key contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:1. The paper introduces a three-level hierarchy of marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which iteratively solves large positive-definite systems of linear equations to approximate the marginal likelihood gradient.2.
