|**2024-05-24**|**Sparse Expansion and Neuronal Disentanglement**|Shashata Sawmya et.al.|Here is a concise summary of the key contributions and main ideas from the paper's abstract and introduction:Contributions: We propose a novel approach called Sparse Expansion, which improves the inference efficiency of a large language model (LLM) by expanding it into a mixture of sparse experts, each expert being a copy of the original weights, one-shot pruned for a specific cluster of input values. Our approach outperforms all other one-shot sparsification approaches for the same inference FLOP budget per token, achieving significant speedups for generative inference.Main ideas: The key idea behind Sparse Expansion is to disentangle the input-output relationship of every individual neuron across clusters of inputs, allowing the model to better fit the output distribution and improve its sparse performance. We show that highly entangled neurons are difficult to sparsify and that disentanglement is a key factor in the performance of Sparse Expansion.|[2405.15756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15756v1)|null|
