A general theoretical description of spin self-diffusion under nonlinear gradient fields is proposed, which extends the effective phase diffusion method for linear gradient fields.2. The proposed method reveals the general features of phase evolutions in nonlinear gradient fields, including phase diffusion, float phase evolution, and shift based on the starting position.3. The method shows that the diffusing and float phase evolutions come from the first and second derivatives of the gradient field, and obtains the phase variance and corresponding NMR signal attenuation.4. The results indicate that signal attenuation obeys Gaussian attenuation for a short time, then changes to Lorentzian or Mittag-Leffler function attenuations when time increases, significantly different from Gaussian attenuation.5. The method can handle random order nonlinear gradient fields and is applicable to various situations, including higher-order gradient fields and fractional diffusion.The authors also outline the challenges in existing theories, including discrepancies in reported results, limits in applicability, and the need for a more general and versatile theoretical treatment. The proposed method aims to address these challenges and provide a broader view of phase evolution under the influence of nonlinear gradient fields.|[2405.18514v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18514v1)|null|

The authors propose a three-level hierarchy for marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which allows for a trade-off between computation time and accuracy of the solution.2. They identify that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations.3. They propose a warm start method, which reuses the solution of the previous step as an initialisation for the next step, providing a significant speed-up without degrading performance.4. They demonstrate the effectiveness of the warm start method on regression tasks, achieving the same results as the conventional procedure while providing up to a 16x average speed-up among datasets.5. They provide an empirical evaluation of the proposed method on various datasets using different linear system solvers, including conjugate gradients, alternating projections, and stochastic gradient descent.|[2405.18328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18328v1)|null|
