Creation of a new set of FF synthetic and real visual scenes with respective camera poses, usable for assessing NVS methods.2. Subjective evaluation of NVS methods using a well-known and reliable subjective assessment methodology, considering different scene classes and recently proposed NVS methods.3. Evaluation of the performance of state-of-the-art IQA and VQA metrics in the context of NVS, using different scene classes.**Main Points:**1. NVS is a technology that enables high-quality, immersive visual content from multiple viewpoints, with applications in virtual/augmented reality, 3D modeling, and film entertainment.2. NVS methods have structural limitations that may lead to artifacts in the final visual result, negatively impacting perceived quality.3.

The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of NVS quality assessment, including subjective and objective assessments, and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of different NVS solutions for different scene classes.|[2405.20078v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20078v1)|null|
