|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. The authors compare the performance of a Poisson-Lindley integer autoregressive (PLINAR(1)) model with traditional Gaussian autoregressive (AR) models for forecasting discrete time series.2. They propose two methods for equating moments of the PLINAR(1) to the Gaussian AR(1) model, namely the marginal method and the innovation method.3. The authors apply the PLINAR(1) model to a discrete time series data set and compare its performance with the traditional Gaussian AR(1) model.4. They investigate the properties of the PLINAR(1) model, including its marginal and conditional distributions, and compare these with those of the Gaussian AR(1) model.The main conclusion drawn from the paper is that the PLINAR(1) model outperforms the traditional Gaussian AR(1) model for discrete time series data with overdispersion, and that the innovation method is a better choice for approximating the conditional Poisson-Lindley PMF for moderate values of α and moderate to large values of θ.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

A limiting distribution for a wide class of multiplicative functions f∈M, where M is the set of multiplicative functions.2.
