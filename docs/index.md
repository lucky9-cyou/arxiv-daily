Novel framework called GFlow that can reconstruct 4D scenes from a single, uncalibrated video input without assuming any camera parameters or multi-view video inputs.2. GFlow uses 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video to a 4D explicit representation, enabling the reconstruction of dynamic 4D worlds alongside camera poses.3.

Scene clustering separates the scene into still and moving parts, while the sequential optimization process optimizes camera poses and Gaussian points based on 2D priors and scene clustering.4. GFlow can also track any points across frames in 3D world coordinates without prior training and segment moving objects from the scene in an unsupervised way.5. The framework has the ability to render novel views of a video scene by changing camera poses, allowing for scene-level or object-level editing as desired.|[2405.18426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18426v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement**|Jinyan Chen et.al.|The key contributions of the paper are summarized as follows:1. **Even-Parity Precession Protocol**: Introduced a new protocol that measures a uniformly-precessing observable at one of $K$ chosen times. This protocol detects Wigner negativity and entanglement in close analogy to the odd-parity protocol.2. **Quantum Violation**: Shown that the classical bound for a quantum system can be violated using this protocol.3. **Wigner Negativity Volume**: Related the quantum violation to Wigner negativity, which can be used as a measure of nonclassical behavior.4. **Specific Systems**: Analyzed specific systems, such as harmonic oscillators and spin systems, and shown that their quantum scores match or exceed the classical bounds.In particular, the paper finds that:* For quantum harmonic oscillators, the even-parity precession protocol can detect Wigner negativity and entanglement, and the maximum score approaches 1/K in the classical limit.* For spin systems, including those with $j > K/2$, the even-parity precession protocol can also detect genuine multipartite entanglement and nonclassical states.* For spin systems with $j = K/2$, the even-parity precession protocol detects a lower bound for the Wigner negativity, which can be used as a measure of nonclassical behavior.* Additionally, the paper provides specific bounds for the maximum scores of various systems, indicating that they can indeed reach the classical bound or higher.Overall, the even-parity precession protocol is a general and useful tool for detecting nonclassical behavior in various physical systems, including harmonic oscillators and spin systems.|[2405.17966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17966v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**GFlow: Recovering 4D World from Monocular Video**|Shizun Wang et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The paper proposes a novel framework, GFlow, that can reconstruct dynamic 4D scenes from a single, uncalibrated video input without any camera parameters as input.* GFlow uses a new approach that leverages 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video (3D) to a 4D explicit representation, entailing a flow of Gaussian splatting through space and time.* The framework consists of two main components: scene clustering and optimization. Scene clustering separates the scene into still and moving parts, while optimization is a sequential process that optimizes camera poses and the dynamics of 3D Gaussian points based on 2D priors and scene clustering.* GFlow can also track any points across frames in 3D world coordinates without prior training and segment moving objects from the scene in an unsupervised manner.* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of GFlow on two challenging video datasets, DAVIS and Tanks and Temples, and achieves state-of-the-art results in video reconstruction quality and camera pose accuracy.|[2405.18426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18426v1)|null|

The warm start method is designed to reduce the number of required linear system solver iterations, which can significantly speed up the optimisation process.|[2405.18328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18328v1)|null|

The protocol is based on measuring a uniformly-precessing observable at different points in time and calculating a score that is bounded by the classical bound. The authors show that the quantum score can violate the classical bound for certain systems, including the quantum harmonic oscillator and spin angular momentum systems.The paper also introduces a new protocol for detecting entanglement in spin ensembles, which is based on measuring the collective spin of the ensemble at different points in time. The authors show that this protocol can detect entanglement in systems that were previously thought to be too small to be detected by other methods.The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:1. Introduction of the even-parity precession protocol, which can detect nonclassicality in various quantum systems.2. Demonstration of the protocol's ability to detect nonclassicality in the quantum harmonic oscillator and spin angular momentum systems.3. Introduction of a new protocol for detecting entanglement in spin ensembles.4. Showcasing the protocol's ability to detect entanglement in systems that were previously thought to be too small to be detected by other methods.The key equations and results from the paper are:* The even-parity precession protocol is defined as: Ax(Œ∏) = cos(Œ∏)Ax(0) + sin(Œ∏)Ay(0), Ay(Œ∏) = cos(Œ∏)Ay(0) - sin(Œ∏)Ax(0)* The classical bound is sc K,‚àÜ = 1/K* The quantum score is defined as: s K,‚àÜ = tr[E‚àûK[Px‚àÜ]]* The protocol can detect nonclassicality in the quantum harmonic oscillator and spin angular momentum systems.* The protocol can detect entanglement in spin ensembles.* The maximum score for the even-parity precession protocol is: s K,‚àÜ = 2- [K+‚àÜ^2]/K+1Overall, the paper provides a new protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement in quantum systems, and showcases its ability to detect entanglement in systems that were previously thought to be too small to be detected by other methods.|[2405.17966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17966v1)|null|

The model is derived from an optimal transport objective that transforms input signals to achieve a target response distribution. The paper demonstrates how local interneurons may adjust their connectivity and response properties to reshape the distribution of circuit responses, thus facilitating efficient transmission of information.The abstract and introduction highlight the limitations of current normative models of neural circuits, which are mainly linear and unable to capture the nonlinearity and complexity of neural responses. The paper argues that optimal transport provides a more powerful framework for modeling neural circuits, allowing them to adapt to the structure of their inputs and to optimize the transmission of information.Overall, the key contributions of the paper are the development of a nonlinear normative model of a neural circuit, the integration of optimal transport with circuit dynamics, and the exploration of how interneuron properties affect circuit responses.|[2405.17745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17745v1)|null|
