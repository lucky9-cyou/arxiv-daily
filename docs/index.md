|**2024-05-28**|**Improving Linear System Solvers for Hyperparameter Optimisation in Iterative Gaussian Processes**|Jihao Andreas Lin et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction can be summarized as follows:1. The paper introduces three improvements to iterative methods for Gaussian process regression:	* A pathwise gradient estimator, which reduces the required number of solver iterations and amortises the computational cost of making predictions.	* Warm starting linear system solvers with the solution from the previous step, which leads to faster solver convergence at the cost of negligible bias.	* Early stopping linear system solvers after a limited computational budget, which synergises with warm starting, allowing solver progress to accumulate over multiple marginal likelihood steps.2. The paper demonstrates that these improvements can provide speed-ups of up to 72x when solving to tolerance and decrease the average residual norm by up to 7x when stopping early.3. The paper introduces a hierarchical view of marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative GPs, which involves bi-level optimisation with an outer-loop optimiser, a gradient estimator, and a linear system solver.4. The paper presents results on several datasets, including 3DROAD, SONG, BUZZ, and HOUSE, using different linear system solvers (conjugate gradients, alternating projections, and stochastic gradient descent) and pathwise or standard gradient estimators with or without warm starting.5. The paper evaluates the performance of the different methods in terms of relative residual norms, test root-mean-square errors, and test log-likelihoods, and shows that the proposed improvements can lead to better performance and faster convergence.|[2405.18457v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18457v1)|null|
