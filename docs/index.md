Analytical description of the stochastic gradient descent dynamics of a linear classifier in a teacher-student setup modeling different data sub-populations with a Gaussian-mixture model.2. Characterization of the evolution of bias throughout training, showing a three-phase learning process where bias exhibits non-monotonic behavior.3. High-dimensional analysis demonstrating that the dynamics of the classifier can be expressed using a few sufficient statistics, which converge to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be solved exactly in the setting.**Insights:**1. The paper reveals a complex time-dependence of learning with structured data, which previous theoretical studies have failed to capture.2.
