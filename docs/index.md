|**2024-05-28**|**An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement**|Jinyan Chen et.al.|The paper presents a novel non-classicality protocol called the "even-parity precession protocol" that can detect non-classicality in quantum systems with uniformly precessing observables. The protocol is based on measuring a uniformly precessing observable at different times and has the advantage of not requiring simultaneous or sequential measurements. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol by applying it to the quantum harmonic oscillator, a spin angular momentum system, and a spin ensemble. They also prove that the protocol can detect Wigner negativity, entanglement, and genuine multipartite entanglement in these systems.The key contributions of the paper are:1. Introduction of the even-parity precession protocol, which is a novel non-classicality test that can detect non-classicality in quantum systems with uniformly precessing observables.2. Application of the protocol to the quantum harmonic oscillator, a spin angular momentum system, and a spin ensemble, and demonstration of its ability to detect Wigner negativity, entanglement, and genuine multipartite entanglement in these systems.3. Proof that the protocol can detect all states that commute with the parity operator, which was previously missed by similar protocols built from Tsirelson's original precession protocol.4. Show that the protocol can detect Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, which were previously undetectable by similar protocols.The protocol is based on the concept of uniformly precessing observables, which is a new perspective on quantum non-classicality. The authors use this concept to develop a novel non-classicality test that can detect non-classicality in quantum systems without requiring simultaneous or sequential measurements.The results of the paper have significant implications for our understanding of quantum non-classicality and the development of novel quantum non-classicality tests. The protocol presented in the paper has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including quantum information processing, quantum cryptography, and quantum metrology.|[2405.17966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17966v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**On the Structure of Multivariate Gabor Frames and a Higher-Dimensional Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallstén Result**|Michael Gjertsen et.al.|The key contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:1. The paper introduces an equivalence relation on the set of lattices in R2d, such that equivalent lattices share identical structures of Gabor frames, up to unitary equivalence.2. The authors parameterize these equivalence classes by symplectic forms on R2d and show that they consist of lattices related by symplectic transformations.3. They prove that symplectic transformations are the only linear transformations of the time-frequency plane that implement these equivalences, characterizing symplectic transformations as the structure-preserving transformations of the time-frequency plane in the context of Gabor analysis.4. The paper extends the power and centrality of the result of symplectic covariance, showing that it is compatible with the duality that is central to Gabor analysis and reinterpreting it in a way that is better suited to concrete computations and applications.5. The authors introduce a higher-dimensional variant of the Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallst'en theorem for Gaussian Gabor frames and use it to prove necessary and sufficient conditions for d-parameter families of Gaussians to generate Gabor frames.6. They show that separable lattices are intimately related to the well-known notion of transversal Lagrangian planes and explore the case of separable lattices from a computational and geometrical point of view.These contributions highlight the importance of symplectic geometry in understanding the structure of Gabor systems and provide a framework for studying the equivalence classes of lattices in R2d that share identical structures of Gabor frames.|[2405.18125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18125v1)|null|
