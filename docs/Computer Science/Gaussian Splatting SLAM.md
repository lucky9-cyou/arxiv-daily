|**2024-05-28**|**GFlow: Recovering 4D World from Monocular Video**|Shizun Wang et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The paper proposes a novel framework, called GFlow, that reconstructs dynamic 4D scenes from a single, uncalibrated video input without any camera parameters.* GFlow uses an explicit representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting to represent the video content as a fluid flow of Gaussian points through space and time.* The framework consists of two main components: scene clustering that separates the scene into still and moving parts, and a sequential optimization process that optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussian points based on 2D priors and scene clustering.* The paper addresses the challenges of dynamic scene reconstruction, including the complexity of video dynamics, and proposes a new pixel-wise densification strategy to integrate new visual content.* The paper also discusses the advantages of GFlow, including its ability to track any points across frames in 3D world coordinates without prior training, segment moving objects from the scene in an unsupervised manner, and render new views of video scenes by easily changing camera poses.|[2405.18426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18426v1)|null|

The authors propose a new method called "importance sampling with local tilt" for investigating the counting statistics of one-dimensional systems, which avoids the difficulties associated with discrete observables.2.

|**2024-05-28**|**An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement**|Jinyan Chen et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. The introduction of an even-parity precession protocol, which can detect nonclassicality in quantum systems, including Wigner negativity and entanglement, using only measurements of a uniformly-precessing observable at different times.2. The protocol can be implemented in various physical systems, such as the quantum harmonic oscillator, spin ensembles, and collective degrees of freedom.3. The even-parity protocol is designed to detect states that commute with the parity operator, which were missed by similar protocols built from Tsirelson's original precession protocol.4. The protocol can detect Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of even numbers of qubits using only collective spin measurements, which closes a long-standing gap in the field.The paper's main results can be summarized as follows:1. The quantum harmonic oscillator: The authors show that the even-parity protocol can detect Wigner negativity and entanglement in the quantum harmonic oscillator, and that the maximum score is at least the classical bound.2. Spin ensembles: The authors show that the even-parity protocol can detect GHZ states of even numbers of qubits using only collective spin measurements, and that the maximum score is at least the classical bound.3. The relationship between quantum violation and Wigner negativity: The authors show that the Wigner negativity volume is bounded by the quantum score, and that the lower bound approaches 1/K as Ïƒ â†’ 0.The paper's results have implications for the study of nonclassicality and entanglement in quantum systems, and demonstrate the power of the even-parity precession protocol in detecting nonclassicality and entanglement in a wide range of physical systems.|[2405.17966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17966v1)|null|
