|**2024-05-28**|**GFlow: Recovering 4D World from Monocular Video**|Shizun Wang et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. Novel framework called GFlow that can reconstruct 4D scenes from a single, uncalibrated video input without assuming any camera parameters or multi-view video inputs.2. GFlow uses 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video to a 4D explicit representation, enabling the reconstruction of dynamic 4D worlds alongside camera poses.3. The framework consists of two main components: scene clustering and sequential optimization. Scene clustering separates the scene into still and moving parts, while the sequential optimization process optimizes camera poses and Gaussian points based on 2D priors and scene clustering.4. GFlow can also track any points across frames in 3D world coordinates without prior training and segment moving objects from the scene in an unsupervised way.5. The framework has the ability to render novel views of a video scene by changing camera poses, allowing for scene-level or object-level editing as desired.|[2405.18426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18426v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement**|Jinyan Chen et.al.|The key contributions of the paper are summarized as follows:1. **Even-Parity Precession Protocol**: Introduced a new protocol that measures a uniformly-precessing observable at one of $K$ chosen times. This protocol detects Wigner negativity and entanglement in close analogy to the odd-parity protocol.2. **Quantum Violation**: Shown that the classical bound for a quantum system can be violated using this protocol.3. **Wigner Negativity Volume**: Related the quantum violation to Wigner negativity, which can be used as a measure of nonclassical behavior.4. **Specific Systems**: Analyzed specific systems, such as harmonic oscillators and spin systems, and shown that their quantum scores match or exceed the classical bounds.In particular, the paper finds that:* For quantum harmonic oscillators, the even-parity precession protocol can detect Wigner negativity and entanglement, and the maximum score approaches 1/K in the classical limit.* For spin systems, including those with $j > K/2$, the even-parity precession protocol can also detect genuine multipartite entanglement and nonclassical states.* For spin systems with $j = K/2$, the even-parity precession protocol detects a lower bound for the Wigner negativity, which can be used as a measure of nonclassical behavior.* Additionally, the paper provides specific bounds for the maximum scores of various systems, indicating that they can indeed reach the classical bound or higher.Overall, the even-parity precession protocol is a general and useful tool for detecting nonclassical behavior in various physical systems, including harmonic oscillators and spin systems.|[2405.17966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17966v1)|null|
