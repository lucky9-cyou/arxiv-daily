|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|The key contributions of the paper can be summarized as:1. The authors compared the performance of the Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR(1)) model with a traditional Gaussian AR(1) model and two modified versions of the traditional Gaussian AR(1) model in forecasting discrete time series.2. The authors showed that the PLINAR(1) model is more suitable for modeling and forecasting discrete time series with overdispersion, which is a common phenomenon in real-world data.3. The authors introduced two methods for equating the moments of the PLINAR(1) model to the Gaussian AR(1) model, and compared the performance of the two methods using Kullback-Liebler divergence and Kolmogorov metric.4. The authors applied the PLINAR(1) model to a discrete time series data set with overdispersion and compared its performance with the Gaussian AR(1) model and its modified versions. The results showed that the PLINAR(1) model outperformed the other models in forecasting the data.5. The paper also provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on discrete time series modeling and forecasting, including the benefits and limitations of the Poisson-Lindley distribution and the PLINAR(1) model.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**A Pixel Is Worth More Than One 3D Gaussians in Single-View 3D Reconstruction**|Jianghao Shen et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:The Hierarchical Splatter Image method is proposed to learn a two-layer hierarchy of parent-child 3D Gaussians at each pixel, which generalizes the one-to-one pixel-to-3D-Gaussian mapping in the vanilla Splatter Image to a one-to-many mapping. The child 3D Gaussians are learned conditioning on the parent 3D Gaussian and target views, enabling the model to recover occluded details that are often missed by parent Gaussians.
