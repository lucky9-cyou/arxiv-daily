|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|The paper discusses the performance of a Poisson-Lindley Integer-Valued Autoregressive (PLINAR) model in forecasting discrete time series, and compares it with traditional Gaussian AR(1) and two modified versions of the traditional Gaussian AR(1) model. The authors found that the PLINAR model outperformed its Gaussian counterparts in the considered data set, which had overdispersion.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions**|Ofir Gorodetsky et.al.|The key contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:* The authors prove a central limit theorem for a wide class of multiplicative functions f, showing that the random sum Sx, which is the sum of α(n)f(n) over n ≤ x, has a limiting distribution that is a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with f.* The authors also show that the limiting distribution is stable in the sense of Definition B.1, meaning that the convergence is preserved under certain transformations.* The authors provide several examples of multiplicative functions f for which the central limit theorem holds, including the z-th divisor function, indicator functions of integers with few prime factors, and multiplicative functions supported on squarefree integers.* The authors also provide a connection between the limiting distribution of Sx and the Euler product associated with α(n)f(n), and they show that the random measure m∞(ds) is singular continuous and has a support property that is closely related to multi-fractal analysis.These results provide new insights into the behavior of random multiplicative functions and their limiting distributions, and they have implications for various areas of mathematics and physics, such as number theory, algebraic geometry, and probability theory.|[2405.20311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Characterization of probability distributions on some locally compact Abelian groups containing an element of order 2**|Gennadiy Feldman et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:**Contributions:**1. The authors generalize the Heyde theorem, which characterizes Gaussian distributions on the real line by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another.2. The theorem is generalized to groups of the form R × F, where F is a finite Abelian group with a 2-component isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 2.3. The authors prove that in this case, a new class of probability distributions is characterized.4. The proof involves a new method that considers both the characteristic functions and the distributions themselves, which may have applications in other characterization problems.**Key statements:**1. The paper introduces the notation and sets up the problem of generalizing the Heyde theorem to groups of the form R × F.2. The authors state that the presence of an element of order 2 in a group plays an exceptional role in generalizing the Heyde theorem.3. They introduce several lemmas and propositions that are used to prove the main theorem.4. The main theorem states that if a topological automorphism α of the group X satisfies certain conditions, then the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another is symmetric if and only if the characteristic function of the distribution satisfies a certain equation.Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of characterization problems in probability theory, generalizing the Heyde theorem to new classes of groups.|[2405.20087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20087v1)|null|
