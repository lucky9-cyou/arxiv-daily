|**2024-05-24**|**Sparse Expansion and Neuronal Disentanglement**|Shashata Sawmya et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The authors propose a new method called Sparse Expansion, which improves the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by expanding them into a mixture of sparse experts.* Each expert is a copy of the original weights, one-shot pruned for a specific cluster of input values.* The authors show that Sparse Expansion outperforms other one-shot sparsification approaches for the same inference FLOP budget per token, and that this gap grows as sparsity increases, leading to inference speedups.* The authors provide strong evidence that the mixture of sparse experts effectively "disentangles" the input-output relationship of every individual neuron across clusters of inputs, which is key to the performance of Sparse Expansion.|[2405.15756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15756v1)|null|

|**2024-05-24**|**Fast adiabatic preparation of multi-squeezed states by jumping along the path**|Chuan Chen et.al.|The paper introduces a novel shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) method for the fast preparation of multi-squeezed states. The key contributions are:1. The authors develop a STA method that simplifies the process and accelerates the preparation of multi-squeezed states without the need for counterdiabatic control.2. The method is demonstrated to prepare high-fidelity and fast multi-squeezed states, as well as hybrid entangled states between a bosonic mode and a qubit.3. The paper shows that the STA method can robustly prepare multi-squeezed states with large phase-space Wigner negativities, which are valuable non-Gaussian resources in quantum information technology.In summary, the paper presents a new STA method for the preparation of multi-squeezed states, which accelerates the preparation process and eliminates the need for counterdiabatic control.|[2405.15595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15595v1)|null|
