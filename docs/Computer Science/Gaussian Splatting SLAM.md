|**2024-05-24**|**Sparse Expansion and Neuronal Disentanglement**|Shashata Sawmya et.al.|Key contributions:* The paper presents Sparse Expansion, a new method for improving the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs) through a mixture of sparse experts, each of which is a copy of the original model, one-shot pruned for a specific cluster of input values.* The authors show that, for models such as Llama 2 70B, Sparse Expansion outperforms all other one-shot sparsification approaches for the same inference FLOP budget per token, and that this gap grows as sparsity increases, leading to inference speedups.* The main technical contribution is a study of how Sparse Expansion "disentangles" the neuronal output distributions, and shows that this disentanglement is key to the performance of Sparse Expansion.Note: The contribution is summarized in a single sentence under 50 words.|[2405.15756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15756v1)|null|

Nonlinear Helmholtz equation with high frequencies and corner singularities is discretized using the linear finite element method (FEM).2.

A new residual-type error estimator is derived, which is equivalent to the standard one, but has a significant impact on the error estimate in the preasymptotic regime.4. Asymptotic a posteriori estimates are derived, which suggest that the error estimator underestimates the error of the FE solution in the preasymptotic regime.5. The paper proves the convergence and quasi-optimality of an adaptive FEM using the new error estimator, for the first time, for the nonlinear Helmholtz equation.6. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency of the adaptive FEM in reducing pollution errors using the continuous interior penalty (CIP) technique.|[2405.15344v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15344v1)|null|
