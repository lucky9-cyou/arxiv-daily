Gidaro et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:**Key Contributions:**1. The paper compares the performance of a Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR) model with a traditional Gaussian autoregressive (AR) model for forecasting discrete time series.2. The authors evaluate the accuracy of the PLINAR model using two approximation methods: the marginal method and the innovation method.3. The paper applies the PLINAR model to a real-world dataset with overdispersion, demonstrating its improved performance compared to the Gaussian AR model.4. The authors also discuss the limitations of the Gaussian AR model for modeling discrete time series and highlight the potential advantages of using the PLINAR model.**Summary of the Paper:**The paper first reviews the basics of the Poisson-Lindley distribution and its application to discrete time series analysis. The authors then introduce the PLINAR model and describe its properties, including its marginals and autocorrelation function. The paper then compares the performance of the PLINAR model with the traditional Gaussian AR model using two approximation methods: the marginal method and the innovation method. The authors also apply the PLINAR model to a real-world dataset with overdispersion and compare its performance with the Gaussian AR model.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions**|Ofir Gorodetsky et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:**Theorem 1.1**: For a wide class of multiplicative functions f, the sum Sx = (cid:113)(cid:80) n≤x α(n)f (n) normalized to have mean square 1 has a limiting distribution. The limiting distribution is a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with f.**Corollary 1.2**: The convergence of moments is also established, showing that the 2q-th absolute moment of Sx converges to Γ(1 + q)E[V q∞] as x → ∞.**Examples**: The theorem applies to various examples, including:* The z-th divisor function dz, if z ∈ (0, 1√2)* The indicator function of integers with k prime factors* The indicator function of sums of two squares* Any multiplicative function f that takes values in [−1, 1] and satisfies a certain condition on its behavior at infinity**Notation**: α(n) is a Steinhaus or Rademacher random multiplicative function, and f(n) is a multiplicative function. β(n) is a Rademacher random multiplicative function supported on squarefree integers.**Stable Convergence**: The convergence result is stated in terms of stable convergence, which means that the convergence holds in a stronger sense than usual convergence in distribution. Specifically, the convergence holds jointly with the convergence of conditional variances.**Convergence of Random Measures**: The limiting distribution is represented as a random measure m∞(ds) on the real line, and the convergence is established in the sense of vague convergence of measures.|[2405.20311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311v1)|null|
