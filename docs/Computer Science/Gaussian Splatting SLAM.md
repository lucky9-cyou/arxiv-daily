|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. The authors compare the performance of a Poisson-Lindley integer autoregressive (PLINAR(1)) model with traditional Gaussian autoregressive (AR) models for forecasting discrete time series.2. They propose two methods for equating moments of the PLINAR(1) to the Gaussian AR(1) model, namely the marginal method and the innovation method.3. The authors apply the PLINAR(1) model to a discrete time series data set and compare its performance with the traditional Gaussian AR(1) model.4. They investigate the properties of the PLINAR(1) model, including its marginal and conditional distributions, and compare these with those of the Gaussian AR(1) model.The main conclusion drawn from the paper is that the PLINAR(1) model outperforms the traditional Gaussian AR(1) model for discrete time series data with overdispersion, and that the innovation method is a better choice for approximating the conditional Poisson-Lindley PMF for moderate values of α and moderate to large values of θ.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions**|Ofir Gorodetsky et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction can be summarized as follows:* The paper proves that a wide class of multiplicative functions have a limiting distribution, which is a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with the function.* The random measure is closely related to the infinite Euler product associated to the multiplicative function, but is not absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure.* The paper provides a number of examples of multiplicative functions to which the result applies, including the z-th divisor function, the indicator function of integers with k prime factors, and the indicator function of sums of two squares.* The paper's results are expected to hold for all fixed θ arbitrary close to 1, and may be extended to larger values of θ with slight changes in the assumption for the twist function.The paper's key contributions include the proof of the central limit theorem for a wide class of multiplicative functions, and the development of a new method for analyzing the behavior of these functions. The results have implications for a variety of areas, including number theory, probability theory, and statistical physics.|[2405.20311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311v1)|null|
