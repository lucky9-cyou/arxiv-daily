|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The paper compares the performance of a Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR) model with traditional Gaussian autoregressive (AR) models for forecasting discrete-valued time series.* The PLINAR model is introduced as a potential solution for modeling discrete time series with overdispersion, which can lead to poor performance of traditional AR models.* The paper presents two methods for equating moments of the PLINAR model to the Gaussian AR model, and compares their performance using metrics such as Kullback-Liebler divergence and Kolmogorov metric.* The paper also applies the PLINAR model, as well as three different methods for estimating the model parameters, to a real-world dataset and compares their performance to traditional AR models.Overall, the paper aims to provide a new approach for modeling and forecasting discrete-valued time series, and to evaluate the performance of the proposed PLINAR model compared to traditional AR models.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|
