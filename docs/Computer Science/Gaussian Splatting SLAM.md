|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:The key findings of the paper are:* Forecasts using a Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive process (PLINAR(1)) were compared to those of a traditional Gaussian autoregressive process (AR(1)) and two modified versions of the AR(1) model.* The PLINAR(1) model was found to outperform its Gaussian counterparts for a data set with overdispersion.* The marginal method and innovation method were compared for their ability to approximate the conditional Poisson-Lindley probability mass function (PMF). The innovation method was found to have a smaller standard error than the marginal method, but the two methods performed equally well for moderate values of α and θ.Overall, the paper demonstrates the potential benefits of using the PLINAR(1) model for forecasting discrete time series data, particularly when there is overdispersion in the data.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions**|Ofir Gorodetsky et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The authors prove that the sum of a Steinhaus or Rademacher random multiplicative function with a multiplicative function f has a limiting distribution, which is a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with f.* The authors apply this result to a wide class of multiplicative functions, including the z-th divisor function, the indicator function of integers with a fixed number of prime factors, and the indicator function of sums of two squares.* The authors show that the limiting distribution is non-Gaussian and is closely related to the infinite Euler product associated with the random multiplicative function.In the introduction, the authors also discuss the following:* The concept of multiplicative functions and their importance in number theory.* The difference between Steinhaus and Rademacher random multiplicative functions.* The significance of the random measure m∞(ds) and its relationship to the limiting distribution of the sum.* The history of the problem and the main results in the literature.* The motivation for the current paper and its contributions to the field.|[2405.20311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**An Analysis of AGN-Driven Outflows in the Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 3227**|Julia Falcone et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:The paper studies the ionized, neutral, and warm molecular gas kinematics in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3227 using multi-wavelength observations. The authors fit multiple Gaussians to spatially-resolved emission lines and isolate the kinematics based on apparent rotational and outflowing motions. They determine an orientation for the bicone from which outflows travel, finding an inclination of 40+5-4 degrees from the line of sight and a half-opening angle of 47+6-2 and 68+1-1 degrees inner and outer boundaries. They observe ionized outflows traveling 500 km/s at distances up to 7'' (800 pc) from the SMBH and disturbed ionized gas up to a distance of 15'' (1.7 kpc). They also measure a turnover radius where the gas starts decelerating at a distance of 26+6 pc from the AGN, confirming radiative driving as the dominant acceleration mechanism for the NLR outflows.|[2405.20162v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20162v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Characterization of probability distributions on some locally compact Abelian groups containing an element of order 2**|Gennadiy Feldman et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:The paper generalizes the Heyde theorem, which characterizes Gaussian distributions on the real line by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another, to groups of the form R × F, where F is a finite Abelian group with a 2-component isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 2. The coefficients of the linear forms are arbitrary topological automorphisms of the group. This generalization is done using a new method that simultaneously considers both the characteristic functions and the distributions themselves.The paper's main theorem states that if the conditional distribution of the linear form L2 = ξ1 + αξ2 given L1 = ξ1 + ξ2 is symmetric, then the distributions µj are either Gaussian distributions on the subgroup R or degenerate distributions. The theorem is proved by reducing the problem to solving a functional equation for characteristic functions on the character group of the original group.The paper also provides several lemmas and propositions that are used in the proof of the main theorem. These results include a characterization of the Gaussian distributions on the group R × F, a description of the distributions that are characterized by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another, and a necessary and sufficient condition for a distribution to be a Gaussian distribution on the subgroup R.|[2405.20087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20087v1)|null|
