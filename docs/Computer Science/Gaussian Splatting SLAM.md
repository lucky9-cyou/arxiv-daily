|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|The paper investigates the forecasting of discrete time series using a Poisson-Lindley Integer-Valued Autoregressive (PLINAR) model, a traditional Gaussian Autoregressive (AR) model, and two modified versions of the traditional Gaussian AR model. The authors compare the performance of these models using various metrics, including the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Kolmogorov metric. They also apply the models to a real-world data set and compare their forecasting accuracy.The main contributions of the paper are:1. The introduction of the PLINAR model, which is a generalization of the traditional Gaussian AR model for discrete time series.2. The development of two methods for approximating the conditional Poisson-Lindley distribution, which are used to forecast future values in the PLINAR model.3. The comparison of the forecasting performance of the PLINAR model, the traditional Gaussian AR model, and the two modified versions of the traditional Gaussian AR model using various metrics.4. The application of the models to a real-world data set and the comparison of their forecasting accuracy.Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive investigation of the forecasting of discrete time series using the PLINAR model and other related models, and highlights the importance of considering the properties of the data when selecting a forecasting model.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions**|Ofir Gorodetsky et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The authors prove that the sum of a Steinhaus or Rademacher random multiplicative function and a multiplicative function f, normalized to have mean square 1, has a limiting distribution that is a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with f.* The authors show that this result applies to a wide class of multiplicative functions f, including the z-th divisor function, the indicator function of integers with k prime factors, and the indicator function of sums of two squares.* The authors also prove that the limiting distribution is stable in the sense of Definition B.1, which means that the convergence is not only in distribution but also in a stronger sense.Overall, the paper provides a new and general framework for understanding the limiting behavior of sums of random multiplicative functions, and has implications for a wide range of applications in number theory and probability theory.|[2405.20311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311v1)|null|

The paper generalizes Heyde's theorem to groups of the form R × F, where F is a finite Abelian group whose 2-component is isomorphic to the additive group of integers modulo 2.2. The theorem characterizes a new class of probability distributions, which arises when the group contains an element of order 2.3.
