|**2024-05-28**|**Bias in Motion: Theoretical Insights into the Dynamics of Bias in SGD Training**|Anchit Jain et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions and insights from the paper's abstract and introduction:**Key Contributions:**1. Analytical description of the stochastic gradient descent dynamics of a linear classifier in a teacher-student setup modeling different data sub-populations with a Gaussian-mixture model.2. Characterization of the evolution of bias throughout training, showing a three-phase learning process where bias exhibits non-monotonic behavior.3. High-dimensional analysis demonstrating that the dynamics of the classifier can be expressed using a few sufficient statistics, which converge to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be solved exactly in the setting.**Insights:**1. The paper reveals a complex time-dependence of learning with structured data, which previous theoretical studies have failed to capture.2. The analysis shows that different features of data bias the classifier and cause significant deviations from asymptotic predictions.3. The transient dynamics of bias can be understood by examining the exponents in the equations describing the evolution of order parameters.4. The paper highlights the importance of considering multiple timescales in understanding the emergence and evolution of bias during training.5. The analysis suggests that spurious correlations can lead to transient alignment between the student and shift vectors, which can have significant implications for the development of bias.|[2405.18296v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18296v1)|null|
