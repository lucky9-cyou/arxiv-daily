|**2024-05-28**|**Warm Start Marginal Likelihood Optimisation for Iterative Gaussian Processes**|Jihao Andreas Lin et.al.|Here are the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:**Key Contributions:**1. The authors propose a three-level hierarchy for marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes.2. They identify that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations.3. They introduce a warm start approach by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, which amortises computations and achieves speed-ups.**Introduction Overview:**The authors provide an introduction to Gaussian processes, noting their popularity in machine learning due to their ability to model complex probabilistic dependencies. However, their scalability is often limited by the need to solve large linear systems, particularly when computing the marginal likelihood. They discuss existing methods for approximate marginal likelihood estimation, which are based on iterative methods and have computational costs proportional to the square of the number of training data points. They argue that existing methods may be slow for large datasets, and therefore propose a novel approach based on iterative marginal likelihood optimisation using linear system solvers.**Main Results:**1. A three-level hierarchy for marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which uses iterative methods and linear system solvers.2. A warm start approach to amortise computations by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step.3. Experiments showing that the proposed approach achieves speed-ups up to 16x on regression tasks while maintaining equivalent performance.**Main Methods:**1. Gaussian processes (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) for modelling complex probabilistic dependencies.2. Iterative methods (Gardner et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024) for approximate marginal likelihood estimation.3. Linear system solvers (Hutchinson, 1990; Meyer et al., 2021; Epperly et al., 2024) for approximating gradients of the marginal likelihood.I hope this summary is helpful!|[2405.18328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18328v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement**|Jinyan Chen et.al.|The abstract and introduction of the paper introduce the concept of even-parity precession protocols, which can detect nonclassicality in quantum systems, including Wigner negativity, entanglement, and genuine multipartite entanglement. The protocol measures a uniformly precessing observable at one of K suitably chosen times and assigns a score based on the measurement outcome. The paper shows that this protocol can detect Wigner negativity and entanglement in a different set of states than the odd-parity precession protocol, which was previously developed.The key contributions of the paper are:1. Introduction of the even-parity precession protocol, which can detect nonclassicality in quantum systems.2. Derivation of the matrix elements of the protocol for the quantum harmonic oscillator and spin angular momentum systems.3. Proofs of the classical and quantum bounds for the harmonic oscillator and spin angular momentum systems.4. Applications of the protocol to detecting Wigner negativity, entanglement, and genuine multipartite entanglement in quantum systems.In summary, the paper provides a new protocol for detecting nonclassicality in quantum systems and demonstrates its application to detecting Wigner negativity, entanglement, and genuine multipartite entanglement in specific systems.|[2405.17966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17966v1)|null|
