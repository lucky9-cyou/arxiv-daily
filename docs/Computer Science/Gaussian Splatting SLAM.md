|**2024-05-28**|**On the Structure of Multivariate Gabor Frames and a Higher-Dimensional Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallstén Result**|Michael Gjertsen et.al.|The key contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:1. The paper introduces an equivalence relation on the set of lattices in R2d, such that equivalent lattices share identical structures of Gabor frames, up to unitary equivalence.2. The authors parameterize these equivalence classes by symplectic forms on R2d and show that they consist of lattices related by symplectic transformations.3. They prove that symplectic transformations are the only linear transformations of the time-frequency plane that implement these equivalences, characterizing symplectic transformations as the structure-preserving transformations of the time-frequency plane in the context of Gabor analysis.4. The paper extends the power and centrality of the result of symplectic covariance, showing that it is compatible with the duality that is central to Gabor analysis and reinterpreting it in a way that is better suited to concrete computations and applications.5. The authors introduce a higher-dimensional variant of the Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallst'en theorem for Gaussian Gabor frames and use it to prove necessary and sufficient conditions for d-parameter families of Gaussians to generate Gabor frames.6. They show that separable lattices are intimately related to the well-known notion of transversal Lagrangian planes and explore the case of separable lattices from a computational and geometrical point of view.These contributions highlight the importance of symplectic geometry in understanding the structure of Gabor systems and provide a framework for studying the equivalence classes of lattices in R2d that share identical structures of Gabor frames.|[2405.18125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18125v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement**|Jinyan Chen et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. The introduction of an even-parity precession protocol that can detect nonclassicality of certain quantum states, including Wigner negativity and entanglement.2.

The protocol can detect Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states of an even number of qubits, which was a long-standing open problem.4. The protocol can be implemented in a way that is similar to the odd-parity protocol, but requires a different expression for the score.The key contributions from the paper's appendices are:1.
