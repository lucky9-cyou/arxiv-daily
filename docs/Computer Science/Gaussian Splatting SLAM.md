|**2024-05-28**|**Warm Start Marginal Likelihood Optimisation for Iterative Gaussian Processes**|Jihao Andreas Lin et.al.|The paper's abstract and introduction present the key contributions of warm start marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes. The main contributions are:1. A three-level hierarchy of marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which identifies that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations.2. A warm start method, which reuses solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, providing a significant speed-up in computational time.3. A proof that the warm start method does not degrade performance, and can achieve the same results as the conventional procedure while providing a significant speed-up.The key takeaways from the introduction and abstract are:* Gaussian processes are a powerful machine learning model, but their effectiveness often depends on good hyperparameters, which are typically learned by maximising the marginal likelihood.* Iterative methods can solve the original problem up to a specified numerical precision, allowing a trade-off between compute time and accuracy of a solution.* The warm start method provides a significant speed-up in computational time while maintaining performance.Overall, the paper presents a novel approach to marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which can significantly improve the efficiency of the algorithm while maintaining performance.|[2405.18328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18328v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**Importance Sampling for counting statistics in one-dimensional systems**|Ivan N. Burenev et.al.|Here are the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:* The authors propose an alternative strategy called "importance sampling with the local tilt" to efficiently investigate the counting statistics for one-dimensional systems.* The traditional importance sampling method, which involves exponentially tilting the observable of interest, may be hindered by the discreteness of the observable in the context of counting statistics.* The local tilt approach avoids this issue by focusing on a continuous observable, specifically the kth largest value among the set of random variables.* The authors demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach through the analysis of three prototypical examples: a set of independent Gaussian random variables, the Dyson gas, and the Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process with a steplike initial condition.* The paper's goal is to study the full probability distribution of the counting statistics, rather than focusing on the typical values, and to develop a numerical method that can accurately capture rare events.|[2405.18195v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18195v1)|null|
