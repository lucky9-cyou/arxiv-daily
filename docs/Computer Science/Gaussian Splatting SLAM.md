|**2024-05-28**|**Shaping the distribution of neural responses with interneurons in a recurrent circuit model**|David Lipshutz et.al.|The abstract of the paper proposes a normative computational model that establishes a relationship between the properties of interneurons and the coordinated, nonlinear transformations of sensory circuits. The model is derived from an optimal transport objective that transforms the inputs to achieve a target response distribution. The circuit, comprised of primary neurons and local interneurons, continuously optimizes this objective by adjusting both the synaptic connections between neurons and the interneuron activation functions. The model learns a nonlinear transformation that significantly reduces statistical dependencies in neural responses.The introduction highlights the problem of transforming a signal into a representation with a given target distribution, which is a classical problem with many applications in statistics, signal processing, and machine learning. The paper focuses on the case where the inputs are natural image statistics and the target distribution is a spherical Gaussian. The introduction also discusses the relationship between the physiological and anatomical properties of local interneurons and the coordinated response properties of populations of primary neurons, which remains unclear.In summary, the key contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:* A normative computational model that establishes a relationship between the properties of interneurons and the coordinated, nonlinear transformations of sensory circuits.* A model that optimizes an optimal transport objective to transform the inputs to achieve a target response distribution.* A demonstration of the model's ability to learn a nonlinear transformation that significantly reduces statistical dependencies in neural responses.|[2405.17745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17745v1)|null|
