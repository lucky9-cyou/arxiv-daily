|**2024-05-24**|**Sparse Expansion and Neuronal Disentanglement**|Shashata Sawmya et.al.|The paper contributes to the field of neural network sparsity by introducing a new technique called Sparse Expansion, which improves the inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by expanding them into a mixture of sparse experts. The key contributions of the paper are:* The Sparse Expansion technique, which improves the inference efficiency of LLMs by expanding them into a mixture of sparse experts, each specializing in a distinct subset of input values.* The observation that the mixing of sparse experts allows for a disentanglement of neuron output distributions, which leads to improved sparse performance, especially for highly entangled neurons.* The use of the Wasserstein distance to measure the degree of entanglement of a neuron, and the finding that highly entangled neurons are more difficult to sparsify and have a larger impact on model performance.* Experimental results showing that Sparse Expansion outperforms other one-shot sparsification techniques for all LLMs from the Llama and Pythia families, at low accuracy loss, and achieves non-trivial speedups for generative inference.* The demonstration of the effectiveness of Sparse Expansion across multiple model sizes, sparsity levels, and compression schemes.|[2405.15756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15756v1)|null|
