An empirical comparison of the PLINAR model with traditional Gaussian autoregressive models for forecasting discrete-time series, highlighting the potential benefits of using the PLINAR model for overdispersed data.4. An analysis of the performance of the PLINAR model and the two approximation methods for a real-world dataset, demonstrating the importance of accounting for overdispersion in time series forecasting.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions**|Ofir Gorodetsky et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. A limiting distribution for a wide class of multiplicative functions f∈M, where M is the set of multiplicative functions.2. The limiting distribution is characterized by a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with f.3. The class of f includes the z-th divisor function dz for z strictly between 0 and 1/√2, and other examples such as multiplicative indicators with a certain density.4. The paper also deduces a set of corollaries, including convergence of moments, and discusses potential extensions to larger values of θ.5. The paper employs various techniques from probability theory, including the martingale central limit theorem, to establish the results.Note that the paper's abstract and introduction are quite technical and dense, so I did my best to summarize the key points in a concise and accessible way.|[2405.20311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311v1)|null|
|**2024-05-30**|**A Pixel Is Worth More Than One 3D Gaussians in Single-View 3D Reconstruction**|Jianghao Shen et.al.|The paper presents a Hierarchical Splatter Image method for single-view 3D reconstruction, which addresses the limitation of the original Splatter Image method by learning multiple 3D Gaussians per pixel.

|**2024-05-30**|**Item response parameter estimation performance using Gaussian quadrature and Laplace**|Leticia Arrington et.al.|The abstract and introduction summarize a study that compares the performance of the Laplace and Gauss-Hermite Quanine (GHQ-EM) algorithms for estimating item parameters in pharmacometric item response theory (IRT) models. The study evaluates the algorithms using a simulation study with varying sample sizes and item scenarios. The results show that both algorithms have similar performance in terms of item parameter recovery, and that the GHQ-EM method employed in the mirt package is a well-suited alternative or supportive analytical approach to NONMEM for potential IRT applications.The abstract and introduction highlight the importance of comparing the performance of different algorithms for estimating item parameters in IRT models, as different algorithms may have different strengths and weaknesses. The study finds that the GHQ-EM method has a higher precision and accuracy in estimating the item parameters compared to the Laplace method, and that the method is also more computationally efficient.|[2405.20164v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20164v1)|null|
