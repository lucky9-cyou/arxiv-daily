|**2024-05-28**|**GFlow: Recovering 4D World from Monocular Video**|Shizun Wang et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The paper proposes a novel framework, GFlow, that can reconstruct dynamic 4D scenes from a single, uncalibrated video input without any camera parameters as input.* GFlow uses an explicit representation of the scene as a flow of 3D Gaussian splatting, which can capture the dynamic nature of real-world scenes and the intricacies of camera movement and positioning.* The framework consists of two main components: scene clustering and optimization. Scene clustering separates the scene into still and moving parts, while optimization tunes the camera poses and 3D Gaussian points to ensure fidelity among neighboring points and smooth movement across frames.* GFlow also introduces a new pixel-wise densification strategy to integrate new visual content and track any points across frames in 3D world coordinates without prior training.* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of GFlow on two challenging video datasets, DAVIS and Tanks and Temples, and achieves state-of-the-art results in video reconstruction quality, object segmentation, and camera pose estimation.|[2405.18426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18426v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement**|Jinyan Chen et.al.|The paper presents a novel non-classicality protocol called the "even-parity precession protocol" that can detect non-classicality in quantum systems with uniformly precessing observables. The protocol is based on measuring a uniformly precessing observable at different times and has the advantage of not requiring simultaneous or sequential measurements. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the protocol by applying it to the quantum harmonic oscillator, a spin angular momentum system, and a spin ensemble. They also prove that the protocol can detect Wigner negativity, entanglement, and genuine multipartite entanglement in these systems.The key contributions of the paper are:1. Introduction of the even-parity precession protocol, which is a novel non-classicality test that can detect non-classicality in quantum systems with uniformly precessing observables.2. Application of the protocol to the quantum harmonic oscillator, a spin angular momentum system, and a spin ensemble, and demonstration of its ability to detect Wigner negativity, entanglement, and genuine multipartite entanglement in these systems.3. Proof that the protocol can detect all states that commute with the parity operator, which was previously missed by similar protocols built from Tsirelson's original precession protocol.4. Show that the protocol can detect Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, which were previously undetectable by similar protocols.The protocol is based on the concept of uniformly precessing observables, which is a new perspective on quantum non-classicality. The authors use this concept to develop a novel non-classicality test that can detect non-classicality in quantum systems without requiring simultaneous or sequential measurements.The results of the paper have significant implications for our understanding of quantum non-classicality and the development of novel quantum non-classicality tests. The protocol presented in the paper has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, including quantum information processing, quantum cryptography, and quantum metrology.|[2405.17966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17966v1)|null|
