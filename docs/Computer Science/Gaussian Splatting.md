|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|The key contributions of the paper are:* Compared the performance of a Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR) process with a traditional Gaussian autoregressive (AR) process using different moment-equated methods.* Evaluated the forecasting ability of the PLINAR process and the marginal and innovation methods for approximating the conditional Poisson-Lindley probability mass function (PMF).* Investigated the application of the PLINAR process to a real-world discrete time series dataset and compared its performance with the Gaussian AR process and the marginal and innovation methods.The paper also highlights the limitations of using traditional Gaussian AR processes for modeling and forecasting discrete time series, and argues that the PLINAR process can be a more suitable alternative in certain situations.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|
