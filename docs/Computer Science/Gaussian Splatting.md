|**2024-05-28**|**On the Structure of Multivariate Gabor Frames and a Higher-Dimensional Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallstén Result**|Michael Gjertsen et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:The paper introduces an equivalence relation on the set of lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, such that equivalent lattices share identical structures of Gabor frames, up to unitary equivalence. The equivalence classes are parameterized by symplectic forms on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ and consist of lattices related by symplectic transformations. This implies that $2d^2 - d$ parameters suffice to describe the possible structures of Gabor systems over lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$.The paper also proves that symplectic transformations are the only linear transformations of the time-frequency plane that implement equivalences of this kind, characterizing symplectic transformations as the structure-preserving transformations of the time-frequency plane in the context of Gabor analysis.The paper explores the connection between symplectic geometry and Gabor analysis, including the relationship between separable lattices and transversal Lagrangian planes.The paper introduces a higher-dimensional variant of the Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallstén theorem for Gaussian Gabor frames, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for $d$-parameter families of Gaussians to generate Gabor frames.|[2405.18125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18125v1)|null|
