|**2024-05-28**|**GFlow: Recovering 4D World from Monocular Video**|Shizun Wang et.al.|The key contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:* The authors introduce a novel framework, GFlow, that can reconstruct dynamic 4D scenes from a single monocular video input without camera pose information.* GFlow uses an explicit representation based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which allows it to capture the transient essence of dynamic scenes and handle camera movements and content changes.* The framework consists of a two-stage optimization process, where the first stage separates the scene into still and moving parts, and the second stage optimizes the camera poses and 3D Gaussian points using 2D priors (depth and optical flow) and scene clustering.* GFlow also includes a new pixel-wise densification strategy to integrate new visual content and a way to track any points across frames without prior training.* The authors evaluate GFlow on two challenging video datasets, DAVIS and Tanks and Temples, and achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of video reconstruction quality, camera pose accuracy, and object segmentation accuracy.|[2405.18426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18426v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**Short-time Fokker-Planck propagator beyond the Gaussian approximation**|Julian Kappler et.al.|The paper presents a perturbation approach to calculate the short-time propagator of the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation to arbitrary order in the time increment. The approach preserves probability exactly and allows for the evaluation of expectation values to arbitrary accuracy. The paper derives perturbative expansions for the moments of the spatial increment, the finite-time Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and the mean medium entropy production rate. The results are validated using an explicit multiplicative-noise system with an available analytical solution, and the perturbative approach is shown to be more accurate than the widely used Gaussian approximation of the short-time propagator.|[2405.18381v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18381v1)|null|
|**2024-05-28**|**Warm Start Marginal Likelihood Optimisation for Iterative Gaussian Processes**|Jihao Andreas Lin et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The paper proposes a three-level hierarchy of marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which involves iterative linear system solvers to approximate marginal likelihood gradients up to a specified numerical precision.* The authors identify that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations.* They propose to amortise computations by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, providing a "warm start" that can achieve the same results as the conventional procedure while providing a significant speed-up.In summary, the paper presents a novel approach to marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which leverages iterative linear system solvers and warm starts to improve computational efficiency.|[2405.18328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18328v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**Importance Sampling for counting statistics in one-dimensional systems**|Ivan N. Burenev et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. The authors propose a new importance sampling strategy, called local tilt, which is more efficient than the conventional exponential tilt in dealing with counting statistics in one-dimensional systems.2. The local tilt strategy involves shifting the focus from the discrete observable Q(x;z) to a continuous observable Mk[x], which is usually continuous or "sufficiently smooth".3.

|**2024-05-28**|**On the Structure of Multivariate Gabor Frames and a Higher-Dimensional Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallstén Result**|Michael Gjertsen et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:Key contributions:1. Introduction of an equivalence relation on the set of lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$, where equivalent lattices share identical structures of Gabor frames, up to unitary equivalence.2. The equivalence classes are parameterized by symplectic forms on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ and consist of lattices related by symplectic transformations.3. The number of parameters required to describe the possible structures of Gabor systems over lattices in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ is reduced from $4d^2$ to $2d^2 - d$.4. The symplectic transformations are characterized as the structure-preserving transformations of the time-frequency plane in the context of Gabor analysis.5. The paper also investigates the equivalence classes that have separable lattices as representatives and finds that the parameter space in this case is $d^2$-dimensional.6. The paper provides a higher-dimensional variant of the Lyubarskii-Seip-Wallstén theorem for Gaussian Gabor frames, giving necessary and sufficient conditions for $d$-parameter families of Gaussians to generate Gabor frames.In summary, the paper establishes a connection between symplectic geometry and Gabor analysis, providing a reduction in the number of parameters required to describe the structure of Gabor systems, and characterizing symplectic transformations as structure-preserving transformations.|[2405.18125v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18125v1)|null|
