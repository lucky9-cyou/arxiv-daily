Gidaro et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:* The paper investigates the performance of the Poisson-Lindley Integer-Valued Autoregressive (PLINAR) model compared to traditional Gaussian autoregressive (AR) models for discrete time series forecasting.* The authors highlight the limitations of using Gaussian models for discrete time series and the need for alternative approaches that can account for overdispersion.* The PLINAR model is introduced as a new approach for modeling and forecasting discrete time series, which can handle overdispersion and provide more accurate forecasts.* The authors compare the performance of the PLINAR model with the marginal and innovation methods for approximating the conditional Poisson-Lindley probability mass function (PMF).* An application is presented using real data to evaluate the forecasting potential of the PLINAR model and compare it with traditional Gaussian AR models.Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

The coefficients of the linear forms are arbitrary topological automorphisms of the group.* The authors derive a new class of probability distributions characterized by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another on these groups.* The proof is purely analytical and relies on methods of abstract harmonic analysis and complex analysis.In particular, the authors provide a characterization theorem for the Gaussian distributions on the group ℝ × F, which generalizes the Heyde theorem to a more general setting.|[2405.20087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20087v1)|null|
