|**2024-05-28**|**An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement**|Jinyan Chen et.al.|The paper introduces an even-parity precession protocol, which is a non-classicality test that can detect the Wigner negativity of a single quantum harmonic oscillator or a single spin j≥2, non-Gaussian entanglement of two harmonic oscillators, or genuine multipartite entanglement of a spin ensemble. The protocol is based on the idea of uniformly precessing observables, which have the same dynamics in both classical and quantum theories. The paper shows that the even-parity protocol can detect states that are missed by similar protocols built from Tsirelson's original precession protocol.The main contributions of the paper are:1.

The formula for the quantum score: s∞K,∆ = 1/K ∑k=0 ∏k mkk'(θk)4. The formula for the maximum score: max∆ s(j<K/2)K,∆ = (Δ2 + K2)2(K2 - Δ2)5. The formula for the Wigner function: W(x, p) = (Δ2πℏ)2 ∫dxdp	ff(W(-x, p))These equations are used throughout the paper to prove the main results and to calculate the maximum score of the even-parity protocol.|[2405.17966v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17966v1)|null|
