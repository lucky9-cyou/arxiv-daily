|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The paper investigates the performance of the Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR) model for forecasting discrete time series, compared to traditional Gaussian autoregressive (AR) models.* The PLINAR model is a discrete-time model that can handle overdispersion, which is common in many real-world datasets.* The paper compares the performance of the PLINAR model to two modified versions of the traditional Gaussian AR model, using simulation and real-world data.* The results show that the PLINAR model outperforms the traditional Gaussian AR models in many cases, particularly when the data exhibits overdispersion.Overall, the paper contributes to the development of more accurate and robust methods for forecasting discrete time series, and highlights the importance of considering overdispersion in modeling and forecasting discrete data.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions**|Ofir Gorodetsky et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The authors prove that the sum of a Steinhaus or Rademacher random multiplicative function and a wide class of multiplicative functions has a limiting distribution, which is a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with the multiplicative function.* The authors apply their result to various examples, including the z-th divisor function, the indicator function of integers with k prime factors, and the indicator function of sums of two squares.* The authors also prove that the limiting distribution is stable, meaning that it is invariant under shifts and scalings.* The authors mention that their result is the first to exhibit a non-trivial non-Gaussian limiting distribution for the sum of a random multiplicative function and a multiplicative function.The paper is organized as follows:* Section 1.1 provides examples of multiplicative functions to which the authors' result applies.* Section 1.2 discusses conjectures related to the authors' result.* Section B provides results from probability theory, including the definition of stable convergence and the convergence of random measures.* Section B.3 discusses the convergence of random measures, which is used in the authors' proof.* References are provided at the end of the paper.|[2405.20311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311v1)|null|
|**2024-05-30**|**A Pixel Is Worth More Than One 3D Gaussians in Single-View 3D Reconstruction**|Jianghao Shen et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:The proposed Hierarchical Splatter Image method learns a two-layer hierarchy of parent-child 3D Gaussians to represent a scene and reconstruct novel views. Each pixel is represented by a parent 3D Gaussian and a small number of child 3D Gaussians, learned using a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that conditions on parent 3D Gaussian features and target camera views. This method addresses the limitations of the vanilla Splatter Image in reconstructing occluded contents and achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-image 3D reconstruction tasks.|[2405.20310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20310v1)|null|
