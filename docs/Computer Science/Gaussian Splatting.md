|**2024-05-30**|**A Pixel Is Worth More Than One 3D Gaussians in Single-View 3D Reconstruction**|Jianghao Shen et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:The paper proposes a Hierarchical Splatter Image method, which generalizes the one-to-one pixel-to-3D-Gaussian mapping in the vanilla Splatter Image to a one-to-many mapping using a two-layer hierarchical parent-child 3D Gaussian representation. The key contribution is the introduction of child 3D Gaussians learned via a lightweight MLP that takes as input the projected image features of a parent 3D Gaussian and the embedding of a target camera view, enabling the recovery of occluded details that are often missed by parent Gaussians. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in four single-image 3D reconstruction tasks, particularly reconstructing occluded contents with higher accuracy than the vanilla Splatter Image.|[2405.20310v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20310v1)|null|
