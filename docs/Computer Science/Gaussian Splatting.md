|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:* The paper investigates the performance of forecasting discrete time series using a Poisson-Lindley integer-valued autoregressive (PLINAR) model, a traditional Gaussian autoregressive (AR) model, and two modified versions of the traditional Gaussian AR model.* The PLINAR model is compared to the traditional Gaussian AR model, and is found to outperform it in some cases.* The paper also compares the marginal method and innovation method for approximating the conditional Poisson-Lindley probability mass function (PMF), and finds that the innovation method is preferred when values of α and θ are close to 0 or 1.* An application of the PLINAR model is presented, which demonstrates its ability to outperform the traditional Gaussian AR models.Overall, the paper contributes to the development of a new model for forecasting discrete time series and compares its performance to traditional models.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Item response parameter estimation performance using Gaussian quadrature and Laplace**|Leticia Arrington et.al.|The authors of the paper compare the performance of two estimation algorithms, Laplace and Gauss-Hermite quadrature (GHQ-EM), for estimating item parameters in Item Response Theory (IRT) models. The authors investigated the estimation properties of these algorithms using different sample sizes (50, 250, and 500) and assessment lengths (5 and 20 items). The key contributions of the paper are:* Item parameter estimation was similar between Laplace and GHQ-EM algorithms, with good precision and minimal bias for scenarios with at least 20 items and more than 100 subjects.* GHQ-EM method, employed in the mirt R package, showed ease of use, speed of estimation, and relative accuracy, making it a suitable alternative or supportive analytical approach to NONMEM.* The authors found that the 50-subject sample size may be too small for reliable item parameter estimation, and that incorporating longitudinal data in the IRT model could potentially impact the overall estimation precision.|[2405.20164v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20164v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Characterization of probability distributions on some locally compact Abelian groups containing an element of order 2**|Gennadiy Feldman et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The Heyde theorem is generalized to groups of the form R × F, where F is a finite Abelian group such that its 2-component is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers modulo 2.* The presence of an element of order 2 in F leads to a new class of probability distributions being characterized.* The proof involves a new method that simultaneously considers characteristic functions and distributions, rather than relying solely on functional equations.The main theorem (Theorem 4.2) states that if the conditional distribution of a linear form given another is symmetric, then the distributions are either Gaussian distributions on the subgroup K, or a product of a Gaussian distribution on R and a distribution on the subgroup Z(2) of the form (43).The paper also provides some lemmas and propositions that are used in the proof of the main theorem.|[2405.20087v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20087v1)|null|
