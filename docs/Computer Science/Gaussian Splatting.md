|**2024-05-28**|**Warm Start Marginal Likelihood Optimisation for Iterative Gaussian Processes**|Jihao Andreas Lin et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:1. The paper proposes a new approach to efficient marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which is a common problem in machine learning.2. The approach introduces a three-level hierarchy of marginal likelihood optimisation, which includes iterative optimiser, gradient estimator, and linear system solver.3. The paper shows that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations.4. The approach proposes to amortise computations by reusing solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, providing a "warm start".5. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the warm start approach, achieving the same results as the conventional procedure while providing an average speed-up of 16x among datasets.|[2405.18328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18328v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**Shaping the distribution of neural responses with interneurons in a recurrent circuit model**|David Lipshutz et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:The paper proposes a normative computational model that establishes a relationship between the properties of interneurons and the transformations of sensory circuits. The model is derived from an optimal transport objective that conceptualizes the circuit's input-response function as transforming the inputs to achieve a target response distribution. The circuit adapts its responses using a combination of Hebbian synaptic plasticity and interneuron adaptation, and the algorithm learns a nonlinear transformation that approximately Gaussianizes the responses and reduces statistical dependencies between coordinates. The paper applies the algorithm to the case where the inputs are derived from natural images and the target distribution is a spherical Gaussian, and finds that the algorithm learns a nonlinear transformation that significantly reduces statistical dependencies in neural responses.Note: The paper is a theoretical work that proposes a computational model for understanding the transformation of sensory circuits, and the results are not specific to any particular neural system or dataset.|[2405.17745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17745v1)|null|
