|**2024-05-30**|**Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions**|Ofir Gorodetsky et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:**Main Contributions:**1. The paper proves the limiting distribution of a sum of the form Sx,f = ∑n≤x α(n)f(n), where f is a multiplicative function and α is a Steinhaus or Rademacher random multiplicative function. The limiting distribution is shown to be a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with f.2. The result is applied to various examples, including the z-th divisor function, multiplicative indicators, and other functions. In particular, the z-th divisor function is shown to have a limiting distribution when z is strictly between 0 and 1/√2.3. The paper also studies the moments of the sum Sx,f and proves convergence of moments for fixed q in the range 0 ≤ q ≤ 1/θ, where θ is a parameter associated with f.**New Insights and Techniques:**1. The paper develops a new approach to understanding the behavior of sums of random multiplicative functions, using tools from probability theory and mathematical analysis.2. The authors introduce a new type of random measure, associated with the random multiplicative function α, which plays a crucial role in their results.3. The paper provides new estimates and bounds for various types of sums and convolutions, which are used to prove the main theorems.**Technical Advances:**1. The authors develop a new proof of the martingale central limit theorem for complex-valued martingales, which is used to establish the limiting distribution of the sum Sx,f.2. The paper employs a range of technical tools and estimates, including probability theory, analytic number theory, and fractal geometry.|[2405.20311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Characterization of probability distributions on some locally compact Abelian groups containing an element of order 2**|Gennadiy Feldman et.al.|The key contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:1. The paper generalizes the Heyde theorem, which characterizes Gaussian distributions on the real line by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another, to groups of the form R × F, where F is a finite Abelian group containing an element of order 2.2. The authors prove that the presence of an element of order 2 in the group F leads to a new class of probability distributions that are characterized by the symmetry of the conditional distribution of one linear form of independent random variables given another.3.

|**2024-05-30**|**Iterative Learning Control of Fast, Nonlinear, Oscillatory Dynamics (Preprint)**|John W. Brooks et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the abstract and introduction:The paper proposes an active control system using Iterative Learning Control (ILC) to address the sudden onset of deleterious and oscillatory dynamics in complex systems, which is often difficult to model, predict, and control due to nonlinearity, chaos, and fast dynamics. The proposed approach uses a combination of ILC, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Time-Lagged Phase Portraits (TLPP) to iteratively adjust the system's input parameters to reproduce a desired oscillatory trajectory or state. The system is applied to the Lorenz system, a classic chaotic system, and demonstrates the ability to control the dynamics and identify regions of desired dynamical trajectories. The paper also discusses the importance of understanding the system's sensitivity to its parameters and optimizing the controller accordingly.|[2405.20045v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20045v1)|null|
