|**2024-05-30**|**Evaluating Approximations of Count Distributions and Forecasts for Poisson-Lindley Integer Autoregressive Processes**|Rachel D. Gidaro et.al.|The paper's abstract and introduction highlight the importance of discrete time series modeling, particularly when dealing with overdispersed data. The authors propose the Poisson-Lindley Integer-Valued Autoregressive (PLINAR) process as a more suitable model compared to traditional Gaussian autoregressive models. The PLINAR process is shown to provide coherent forecasts, which is crucial when dealing with discrete data.The key contributions of the paper can be summarized as:* Introducing the PLINAR(1) process as a new model for discrete time series analysis* Showcasing the improved performance of the PLINAR(1) process compared to Gaussian autoregressive models* Highlighting the importance of coherent forecasting in discrete time series modeling* Providing a comparison of the marginal method and innovation method for approximating the conditional Poisson-Lindley PMFThe paper concludes that the PLINAR(1) model outperforms its Gaussian counterparts, particularly in overdispersed data, and that the model's coherent forecasts make it a suitable choice for discrete time series modeling.|[2405.20342v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20342v1)|null|

|**2024-05-30**|**Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions**|Ofir Gorodetsky et.al.|Here is a summary of the key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction:* The authors prove a central limit theorem for sums of random multiplicative functions, where the limiting distribution is a Gaussian times a square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with the multiplicative function.* The random measures are constructed as large-x limits of finite Euler products, and the total mass is shown to be almost surely finite and strictly positive.* The paper presents a wide class of multiplicative functions that satisfy the conditions of the central limit theorem, including the z-th divisor function, the indicator function of squarefree integers, and the indicator function of integers with a given number of prime factors.* The authors also obtain the convergence of moments for the sums of random multiplicative functions, and show that the limiting distribution is stable in the sense of Definition B.1.* The paper includes several examples of multiplicative functions that satisfy the conditions of the central limit theorem, such as the z-th divisor function, the indicator function of squarefree integers, and the indicator function of integers with a given number of prime factors.Overall, the paper provides a significant generalization of previous results on sums of random multiplicative functions, and has implications for a wide range of applications in number theory and probability theory.|[2405.20311v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311v1)|null|

|**2024-05-29**|**Tempered Multifidelity Importance Sampling for Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation**|Bassel Saleh et.al.|The paper's abstract and introduction propose a new method, tempered multifidelity importance sampling, to accelerate the solution of a Bayesian inverse problem in gravitational wave parameter estimation. The authors face the challenge of estimating the parameters of compact binaries that coalesce and produce gravitational waves, which is a multifidelity problem with varying assumptions, levels of fidelity, and computational cost.The paper highlights the difficulties in applying importance sampling to large problems, such as gravitational wave inference, due to the sensitivity of the effective sample size to the chi-squared divergence between the target and biasing probability distributions. To address this issue, the authors propose tempering the biasing distribution, which increases the coverage of the target distribution and improves the overlap in the tails. The optimal temperature is found to be critical for achieving the best efficiency in the method.The authors also discuss the broader applicability of their results, recognizing that the focus on gravitational wave inference has implications for other problems that involve multifidelity models, optimization, uncertainty propagation, data assimilation, control, and sensitivity analysis.In summary, the paper's abstract and introduction describe a new method for accelerating gravitational wave parameter estimation using tempered multifidelity importance sampling, and highlight the potential broader applications of this approach in various fields.|[2405.19407v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19407v1)|null|
