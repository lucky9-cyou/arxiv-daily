|**2024-05-24**|**Sparse Expansion and Neuronal Disentanglement**|Shashata Sawmya et.al.|Here is a concise summary of the key contributions and main ideas from the paper's abstract and introduction:Contributions: We propose a novel approach called Sparse Expansion, which improves the inference efficiency of a large language model (LLM) by expanding it into a mixture of sparse experts, each expert being a copy of the original weights, one-shot pruned for a specific cluster of input values. Our approach outperforms all other one-shot sparsification approaches for the same inference FLOP budget per token, achieving significant speedups for generative inference.Main ideas: The key idea behind Sparse Expansion is to disentangle the input-output relationship of every individual neuron across clusters of inputs, allowing the model to better fit the output distribution and improve its sparse performance. We show that highly entangled neurons are difficult to sparsify and that disentanglement is a key factor in the performance of Sparse Expansion.|[2405.15756v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15756v1)|null|

|**2024-05-24**|**Fast adiabatic preparation of multi-squeezed states by jumping along the path**|Chuan Chen et.al.|Here is a concise summary of the key contributions and main ideas from the paper's abstract and introduction:**Key Contributions:** The paper introduces a novel method called "Shortcuts to Adiabaticity by Modulation" (STAM) for fast and robust preparation of multi-squeezed states, which are valuable quantum non-Gaussian resources. The method eliminates the need for counterdiabatic driving and can prepare multi-squeezed states with unit-fidelity in a short time.**Main Ideas:** The paper discusses the challenges of traditional adiabatic control methods, which rely on slowly varying control fields to prepare quantum states. The authors introduce STAM, which uses a modulation-based approach to accelerate the preparation process and eliminates non-adiabatic errors. The method is demonstrated for the preparation of multi-squeezed states and hybrid entangled states between a bosonic mode and a qubit.**Summary Contribution Statement:** Contributions: a novel STAM method is introduced for fast and robust preparation of multi-squeezed states and hybrid entangled states between a bosonic mode and a qubit.|[2405.15595v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15595v1)|null|
|**2024-05-24**|**A graph-space optimal transport FWI approach based on κ-generalized Gaussian distribution**|Sérgio Luiz E. F. da Silva et.al.|Here is a concise summary of the key contributions and main ideas:**Contributions:** The authors propose a new objective function for Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) based on graph-space optimal transport and κ-generalized Gaussian probability distribution, which can mitigate cycle-skipping issues and non-Gaussian errors.**Main Ideas:**1. The conventional FWI approach assumes Gaussian statistics, which may not always be appropriate in non-linear problems like FWI.2. The authors introduce a new objective function based on κ-generalized Gaussian statistics, which can handle non-Gaussian errors.3. The proposed κ-GSOT-FWI approach can mitigate cycle-skipping issues and is robust against non-Gaussian noise.4. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the classical case in recovering subsurface models and reducing computational runtime.|[2405.15536v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15536v1)|null|
