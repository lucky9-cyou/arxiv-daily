|**2024-05-28**|**GFlow: Recovering 4D World from Monocular Video**|Shizun Wang et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The paper proposes a novel framework, GFlow, that can reconstruct dynamic 4D scenes from a single, uncalibrated video input without any camera parameters as input.* GFlow uses a new approach that leverages 2D priors (depth and optical flow) to lift a video (3D) to a 4D explicit representation, entailing a flow of Gaussian splatting through space and time.* The framework consists of two main components: scene clustering and optimization. Scene clustering separates the scene into still and moving parts, while optimization is a sequential process that optimizes camera poses and the dynamics of 3D Gaussian points based on 2D priors and scene clustering.* GFlow can also track any points across frames in 3D world coordinates without prior training and segment moving objects from the scene in an unsupervised manner.* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of GFlow on two challenging video datasets, DAVIS and Tanks and Temples, and achieves state-of-the-art results in video reconstruction quality and camera pose accuracy.|[2405.18426v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18426v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**Warm Start Marginal Likelihood Optimisation for Iterative Gaussian Processes**|Jihao Andreas Lin et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:* The authors consider iterative methods for Gaussian process regression, which allow for a trade-off between compute time and accuracy of a solution.* They introduce a three-level hierarchy of marginal likelihood optimisation for iterative Gaussian processes, which identifies that the computational costs are dominated by solving sequential batches of large positive-definite systems of linear equations.* They propose a "warm start" method, which reuses solutions of linear system solvers as initialisations in the next step, providing a speed-up of up to 16 times among datasets.The authors' approach is to approximate the marginal likelihood gradient using stochastic trace estimation and iterative linear system solvers, which allows for a trade-off between compute time and accuracy of a solution. The warm start method is designed to reduce the number of required linear system solver iterations, which can significantly speed up the optimisation process.|[2405.18328v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18328v1)|null|

|**2024-05-28**|**An even-parity precession protocol for detecting nonclassicality and entanglement**|Jinyan Chen et.al.|The paper introduces an even-parity precession protocol that can detect nonclassicality in various quantum systems, including continuous variables and discrete variables.

|**2024-05-28**|**Shaping the distribution of neural responses with interneurons in a recurrent circuit model**|David Lipshutz et.al.|The key contributions from the paper's abstract and introduction are:The paper proposes a normative computational model that establishes the relationship between the properties of interneurons and the coordinated response properties of a neural circuit. The model is derived from an optimal transport objective that transforms input signals to achieve a target response distribution. The paper demonstrates how local interneurons may adjust their connectivity and response properties to reshape the distribution of circuit responses, thus facilitating efficient transmission of information.The abstract and introduction highlight the limitations of current normative models of neural circuits, which are mainly linear and unable to capture the nonlinearity and complexity of neural responses. The paper argues that optimal transport provides a more powerful framework for modeling neural circuits, allowing them to adapt to the structure of their inputs and to optimize the transmission of information.Overall, the key contributions of the paper are the development of a nonlinear normative model of a neural circuit, the integration of optimal transport with circuit dynamics, and the exploration of how interneuron properties affect circuit responses.|[2405.17745v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17745v1)|null|
